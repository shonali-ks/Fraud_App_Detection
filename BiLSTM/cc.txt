No issues as such. üòÅ No questions either. It\'s a pretty straightforward app. Pretty much the tagline : " Hotels - Trivago". ü§£ It\'s hillarious and a meme but it works and it\'s true.', "It's so great after it is how I found lots of nice places to stay at great prices. Especially on my super broke person budget. I use this app when traveling is needed.", "I love how using the filters... It didn't show me what I wanted... It showed me better. Trivago is literally what you been looking for.", "great site and easy to use but don't always tell you when a price may be in usd", 'So friendly interface and high flexibility for anyone needs, Hotel definitely travago!', 'My experience with this app is so amazing it has givin me so many ideas and has helped me financially.', 'Good Apps..sometime can get cheaper then with other hotel apps...', 'This is a very good app. It helps me to find the best hotel deals.

I suggest actual proper video it's better to pictures.", 'Quick response to major problems with latest version. Clearing all data from memory and cache and starting from scratch seems to have got it working again. Not ideal but support has been good and very responsive. When working it has been a solid 4*.', 'The app gives you plenty of options to find deals on hotels. The downside is actually booking through a third party website. I was actually redirected to "Agoda." I don\'t know what that is, and I may never find out... Loading issues. üòê', "Worst app of my life. Plz don't trust on it bookings. I have booked a room and paid 2400. But when I reached hotel reception with my father , hotel denied for any booking of my name. While the hotel was recommended by trivago.

I have requested so many times to refund my amount through mail but no positive response is given from this app.", "Uninstalling trivago. This app only promote certain website and doesn't show lowest prices, misleading.", "This app is like a dream come true....... When I first used Trivago, it was bad.

I got a free Google Play Gift card from FreePlayPrizes. Com They're still giving them away so hurry!!! Not useful for comparing since resort fees aren't included in the initial search.

Unfortunately, this Trivago app fails to include resort fees in the initial search unlike other apps that do such as Expedia.", 'I like this apps very helpful, so much thank you trivago, it can save time and money for advance booking thank you and more power', 'The app is not working after the update.

Don't bother downloading - use Trivago in browser instead, or another aggregator altogether.", 'Sluggish, always loading. Searching with the map wont allow you to go back to list view.
